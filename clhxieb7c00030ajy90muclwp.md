Flutter is a free and open-source UI toolkit developed by Google in 2018. It allows developers to build natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop platforms using one programming language from a single codebase. Flutter achieves this through its use of a reactive programming model, in which the UI reacts to changes in the application state, rather than the traditional imperative approach. This allows developers to write less code with fewer bugs and to make changes more quickly. Additionally, Flutter provides a rich set of pre-built widgets and tools that help developers build beautiful and responsive applications with ease. I love to call it pixel-perfect UI!

When Google announced Flutter at Google I/O 2018, there were a lot of controversies among some developers. This was due to the existing framework offering a similar solution, which made the market a little competitive at first. Within the first quarter, the adoption rate increased immensely. Companies and individuals started using Flutter to build amazing solutions effortlessly, saving time and money!

### **When Flutter?**

Letâ€™s assume you have a great idea and you might be wondering how to bring that idea to Live, You might decide to build it on the web, but mobile performance on the web isnâ€™t always great because it may sometimes result in poor mobile performance, and building a native app for both iOS and Android can be time-consuming, difficult to maintain, and expensive.

To address these challenges, there are platform-agnostic solutions or hybrid frameworks that allow you to build your app using a single language in the same building environment while communicating with the respective platforms indirectly via the framework. Flutter is one such platform-agnostic solution that offers a high level of abstraction around the respective platform SDKs. With Flutter, you can develop a mobile app for both Android and iOS platforms, and it is cost-effective.

The above image shows how Flutter works internally.

### **Other Solutions**

Just like we have Flutter, there are existing solutions that offer the same thing as Flutter but with a different approach. This article isn't about a strict comparison between other agnostic solutions and Flutter, but rather a clear explanation of what  
Flutter is. Here are some existing solutions before the advent of Flutter;

* React Native
    
* IONIC
    
* Unity
    
* Xamarin
    
* Cordova
    
    The list continues...
    

### Pros and Cons

##### Like every other software solution, Flutter also has its pros and cons. Although the arguments can be overlooked since they do not severely affect its usability,

### Pros

#### The same codebase, run anywhere:

With Flutter, the need to rewrite software for different platforms is not necessary since a single codebase can be shared across different platforms like Android, iOS, and the Web.

#### Native-like Performance:

Flutter uses a 2D rendering engine called Skia, which is also used by Chrome, Mozilla, and other OSes. Skia made it possible for Flutter to provide a state-of-the-art, Native-like performance. Although, Skia will soon be absolute as Google has introduced a new rendering engine called Impeller on Google IO '23

#### Customizable widgets:

In Flutter, everything is a widget. Flutter offers a rich set of customizable widgets, which allows developers to build custom widgets to fit their needs.

#### Large community and resources:

An ever-evolving community with vast experience in other technologies, including Flutter. On the StackOverflow developer survey for 2022, Flutter tops the chart as the most loved mobile framework.

**Dart Programming Language**  
The Flutter codebase is written in a single programming language called Dart, which is backed by Google. Dart uses the JIT (just in time) compiler to optimize the codebase at run time, and the AOT (ahead of time) compilation eliminates the need for shipping the Dart runtime with the app, reducing the app size.

These are only some of the features that make Flutter an awesome framework.

### Cons

**Weighty Apps:**  
Flutter apps can be weighty compared to natively compiled apps. Flutter apps are large because they include the Flutter framework and engine, which provide the necessary runtime and UI components. This additional framework adds some overhead to the app's file size. It also bundles assets like images and fonts, which are stored within the app's package and thus contribute to the app's size.

**Dartâ€™s low popularity**  
Just like Flutter, Dart is a fairly new language. Even though it is a great language, it is still not able to compete with other languages like Java, Kotlin, C++, Javascript, etc. due to its low popularity. Dart has no other use case aside from mobile application development among developers today.

**Rapid Changes and Updates:**  
Flutter is a young framework that is constantly evolving. This means that it may undergo frequent updates, which can sometimes introduce breaking changes or API modifications. As a result, it can be challenging to stay up-to-date with the latest version of Flutter and ensure that your code is compatible with all of the latest changes.

**Learning Curve:**  
Flutter uses Dart as its programming language since Dart is a relatively new programming language, which may be unfamiliar to developers who are used to other languages like Java or Swift. Learning a new language and understanding how Flutter's widget-based architecture works may require some initial investment in terms of time and effort.

**Native codebase:**  
Even though Flutter harnesses the power of a single programming language, learning the native side of things (i.e., Android and iOS) is sometimes inevitable. For instance, flutter has no direct logic to handle flavor or schemes to implement this, a knowledge of both native sides is required  
  
  
Above are the pros and cons of Flutter. However, they are not limited to these. The list goes on.

#### Conclusion

By now, the idea of what flutter is should no longer be alien to you. The Flutter framework is still a relatively new tool for developers; do not have high expectations for it just yet. While new, it has quickly won the hearts of software engineers, becoming a first option for many. Comparing Flutter to its closest rivals, its growth has been extremely rapid. I think it's worthwhile to give Flutter a try!
